Skeleton Project for API Based Android Application
==============================

Nowadays, the majority of the mobile apps has very little application logic, because most of the logic is normally taken care of by a powerful backend API. As a result, becoming an mobile app developer has never been easier. You basically have to know 2 things:

1. How to effectively communicate with the backend API, i.e., knowing which API endpoint of the server to call for a particular user action and what to do with the response.
2. Designing the UI.

In this project, we will focus on the first point for Android applications. You can just download this project and use it as the base for your android app.
